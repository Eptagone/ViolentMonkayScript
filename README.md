# Violent Monkey script with Typescript + ESLint

This is just a example project to create a Violent Monkey script with Typescript + ESLint

## How to use

The file `src/main.ts` is the main entrypoint or your script and the `.header` file contains the required Violent Monkey header.

Install dependencies (`pnpm install`) and run `pnpm run build` to compile. A file called `dist/my-extension.user.js` will be generated with the header and the final script which you can copy and install in Violent Monkey.

Use `pnpm run watch` to watch for changes and recompile automatically.
